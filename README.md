# Convert Bookmarks to PDF

A web app which converts the bookmark HTML file into a PDF which you can download. It uses a [bookmark parser](https://gist.github.com/devster31/4e8c6548fd16ffb75c02e6f24e27f9b9) made by [devster31](https://github.com/devster31) to parse the bookmark file.

## Usage

#### Step 1
> Export your bookmarks from your browser. The exported file will be an HTML file.

#### Step 2
> Visit this [link](https://bookmarks-pdf.herokuapp.com/) and upload the HTML file!

#### Step 3
> After clicking on the download button, a dialog box will appear through which you can download the PDF.

#### Step 4
> That's it.

## Dependencies
> Make sure you have nodejs installed on your machine. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

## Local Development
> After installing dependencies, run `node index.js`, or `nodemon index.js` if you have nodemon installed globally, to kickstart the development server. But before you do that, make sure to set the PORT number as an environment variable.
