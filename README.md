# Convert Bookmarks to PDF

## Usage

#### Step 1
> Export your bookmarks from your browser. The exported file will be an HTML file.

#### Step 2
> Visit this [link](https://bookmarks-pdf.herokuapp.com/) and upload the HTML file!

#### Step 3
> A dialog box will appear through which you can download the PDF. A3 size format is recommended for the PDF.

#### Step 4
> That's it.

## Dependencies
> Make sure you have nodejs installed on your machine. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

## Local Development
> After installing dependencies, run `node index.js`, or `nodemon index.js` if you have nodemon installed globally, to kickstart the development server. But before you do that, make sure to set the PORT number as an environment variable.
